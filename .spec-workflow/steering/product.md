# Product Overview

## Product Purpose
CC-Manager is a task queue management interface for Claude Code sessions. It provides a unified dashboard for orchestrating, monitoring, and managing complex multi-step AI-assisted development workflows. The product solves the challenge of efficiently managing parallel Claude Code processes and maintaining visibility into long-running development tasks.

## Target Users
**Primary Users**: Development teams and technical leads using Claude Code for complex, multi-session development workflows
- **Pain Points**:
  - Lack of visibility into Claude Code session progress
  - Difficulty managing multiple concurrent AI-assisted tasks
  - No centralized queue for organizing development work
  - Manual session tracking and status monitoring

**Secondary Users**: Individual developers working on large codebases requiring systematic AI assistance
- **Pain Points**:
  - Need to manually track task completion conditions
  - Difficulty resuming interrupted AI sessions
  - No structured approach to AI-assisted development workflows

## Key Features

1. **Task Queue Management**: Create, prioritize, and track development tasks with clear completion conditions
2. **Session Monitoring**: Real-time visibility into Claude Code session status, progress, and token usage
3. **Task Pipeline Visualization**: Visual representation of task states (queued, processing, paused, completed, aborted)
4. **Session History**: Access to historical session data and summaries for audit and learning purposes

## Business Objectives
- **Improve Development Velocity**: Reduce time spent managing AI-assisted development workflows by 40%
- **Enhance Visibility**: Provide complete transparency into AI development processes for team leads
- **Optimize Resource Usage**: Enable efficient allocation of Claude Code sessions across development priorities
- **Standardize Workflows**: Establish consistent patterns for AI-assisted development across teams

## Success Metrics
- **Task Completion Rate**: >85% of queued tasks reach completion state
- **Session Efficiency**: Average token utilization >70% across all sessions
- **User Adoption**: >80% of Claude Code users adopt the queue management interface
- **Time to Resolution**: 50% reduction in time spent tracking and managing AI development tasks

## Product Principles

1. **Transparency First**: Every AI process should be visible, trackable, and auditable
2. **Queue-Driven Workflow**: Structured task management prevents ad-hoc AI usage and improves outcomes
3. **Graceful State Management**: Handle session interruptions, failures, and recovery seamlessly
4. **Developer Experience**: Minimize friction between human intent and AI execution

## Monitoring & Visibility

- **Dashboard Type**: Web-based React application with real-time updates
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections for live session status and progress monitoring
- **Key Metrics Displayed**:
  - Task queue status and progression
  - Active session token consumption
  - Historical completion rates and patterns
  - Error rates and failure analysis
- **Sharing Capabilities**: Read-only task status exports, session summary reports

## Future Vision

The CC-Manager will evolve into a comprehensive AI development orchestration platform that enables teams to scale AI-assisted development processes across large organizations.

### Potential Enhancements
- **Remote Access**: Tunnel-based sharing for stakeholder visibility into development progress
- **Analytics**: Historical performance trends, optimization recommendations, and team productivity metrics
- **Collaboration**: Multi-user task assignment, peer review integration, and team coordination features
- **Integration**: Direct connection to version control, CI/CD pipelines, and project management tools
