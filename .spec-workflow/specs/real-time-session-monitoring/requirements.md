# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Real-Time Session Monitoring provides live visibility into active Claude Code sessions, enabling users to track session progress, monitor resource usage, and detect session state changes as they happen. This feature transforms the static session viewing capability into a dynamic monitoring dashboard that gives immediate insight into ongoing AI-assisted development work.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports the core product objective of "Session Monitoring: Real-time visibility into Claude Code session status, progress, and token usage" as outlined in product.md. It addresses the primary user pain point of "lack of visibility into Claude Code session progress" and enables the key business objective of improving development velocity through enhanced transparency.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Live Session State Detection

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want to see which Claude Code sessions are currently active in real-time, so that I can monitor team progress and identify stuck or stalled sessions immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Claude Code session starts THEN the system SHALL detect the new session within 5 seconds and display it as "Active"
2. WHEN a Claude Code session ends THEN the system SHALL update the status to "Completed" or "Failed" within 5 seconds
3. WHEN a session becomes idle (no activity for 10+ minutes) THEN the system SHALL mark it as "Idle" with last activity timestamp
4. IF multiple sessions are running simultaneously THEN the system SHALL display all active sessions with distinct status indicators

### Requirement 2: Session Progress Tracking

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see real-time progress of my Claude Code sessions including token usage and current activity, so that I can understand session efficiency and estimated completion time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a session is active THEN the system SHALL display current token consumption with running total
2. WHEN a session performs tool operations THEN the system SHALL show the current tool being executed
3. WHEN a session generates responses THEN the system SHALL indicate response generation in progress
4. IF a session exceeds expected duration THEN the system SHALL highlight it as requiring attention

### Requirement 3: Session Health Monitoring

**User Story:** As a technical lead, I want to be alerted when sessions encounter errors or performance issues, so that I can intervene quickly to prevent wasted time and resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a session encounters tool failures THEN the system SHALL display error indicators with failure details
2. WHEN a session consumes tokens rapidly without progress THEN the system SHALL flag it as potentially inefficient
3. WHEN a session becomes unresponsive THEN the system SHALL mark it as "Stalled" after 15 minutes of no activity
4. IF system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL show resource usage warnings

### Requirement 4: Live Update Mechanism

**User Story:** As a user, I want session status updates to appear automatically without manual refresh, so that I can monitor progress hands-free while working on other tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN session state changes occur THEN the UI SHALL update automatically within 2 seconds
2. WHEN multiple users view the same project THEN all users SHALL see synchronized session states
3. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL indicate connection status and attempt reconnection
4. IF updates fail to load THEN the system SHALL show error state with manual refresh option

### Requirement 5: Session Interaction Controls

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to pause, resume, or terminate active sessions from the monitoring interface, so that I can manage resources and redirect focus without switching to the command line.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "Pause Session" THEN the Claude Code process SHALL be suspended and marked as "Paused"
2. WHEN I click "Resume Session" on a paused session THEN the process SHALL continue from where it left off
3. WHEN I click "Terminate Session" THEN the process SHALL be safely stopped and marked as "Terminated"
4. IF a session cannot be controlled THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages with alternative actions

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each monitoring component should handle one aspect of session state
- **Modular Design**: Real-time updates, session controls, and state detection should be separate services
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize coupling between monitoring UI and session management logic
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between real-time data providers and UI components

### Performance
- Real-time updates must not impact system performance or consume excessive resources
- Session state polling should be efficient and not overwhelm the file system
- UI updates should be throttled to prevent excessive re-rendering
- Memory usage must remain stable during extended monitoring sessions

### Security
- Session control operations must be authenticated and authorized
- Real-time data streams must prevent information leakage between projects
- Session termination controls must prevent unauthorized process manipulation
- File system monitoring must respect project access permissions

### Reliability
- Real-time monitoring must continue functioning during session failures
- Network interruptions should not break the monitoring interface
- Session control failures must be handled gracefully with clear error reporting
- System must recover automatically from temporary monitoring service outages

### Usability
- Session status should be immediately understandable through clear visual indicators
- Critical alerts (errors, stalls) should be prominently displayed
- Session controls should provide confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Interface should remain responsive even when monitoring many concurrent sessions
