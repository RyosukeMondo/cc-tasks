# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Claude Code Project Browser is a minimal web-based interface that provides users with visibility into their locally stored Claude Code projects and conversation sessions. This feature addresses the fundamental need for users to understand their project landscape and conversation history without requiring complex real-time monitoring or content parsing capabilities. The browser serves as the foundation layer for future Claude Code management features by establishing core project detection and navigation patterns.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature establishes the foundational layer for Claude Code project management by providing essential visibility and navigation capabilities. It enables users to understand their conversation history and project organization, supporting informed decision-making about session resumption and project selection. The minimal scope ensures rapid delivery of immediate value while establishing the architectural foundation for advanced features like real-time monitoring, session management, and automated task execution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Claude Code user, I want to see all my projects in one centralized location, so that I can quickly understand my project landscape and select projects for further exploration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL scan the `~/.claude/projects/` directory and display all discovered projects
2. IF the projects directory does not exist THEN the system SHALL display a clear message indicating no projects found
3. WHEN multiple projects exist THEN the system SHALL display them in a list format with project names, paths, and last modified dates
4. WHEN a project has no valid meta.json THEN the system SHALL use the directory name as the project name
5. WHEN project scanning fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message with troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Claude Code user, I want to see basic metadata about each project including session counts and activity timestamps, so that I can gauge project activity and prioritize which projects to explore.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the project list THEN the system SHALL display the total number of conversation files for each project
2. WHEN a project contains conversation files THEN the system SHALL show the most recent activity timestamp
3. IF a project has no conversation files THEN the system SHALL indicate "No sessions" clearly
4. WHEN calculating session counts THEN the system SHALL only count valid .jsonl files in the conversations/ directory
5. WHEN file access fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle errors and show available metadata

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Claude Code user, I want to navigate into individual projects to see their conversation sessions, so that I can understand the conversation history and identify specific sessions of interest.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking on a project THEN the system SHALL navigate to a project detail view showing all conversation sessions
2. WHEN viewing project details THEN the system SHALL display session file names, file sizes, and modification dates
3. WHEN no sessions exist in a project THEN the system SHALL display "No conversations found" with guidance
4. WHEN session file access fails THEN the system SHALL show available session metadata and indicate access issues
5. WHEN returning from project details THEN the system SHALL provide clear navigation back to the project list

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Claude Code user, I want the interface to be responsive and intuitive, so that I can efficiently browse my projects without confusion or delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL complete initial project scanning within 3 seconds for up to 50 projects
2. WHEN navigating between views THEN the system SHALL respond within 500ms
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages
4. WHEN using the interface THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent navigation patterns and visual hierarchy
5. WHEN accessing the application THEN the system SHALL work in modern web browsers without additional plugins

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Separate project scanning, metadata parsing, and UI rendering into distinct modules
- **Modular Design**: Create reusable components for project lists, session displays, and error handling
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize external dependencies, use standard Node.js file system APIs
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between backend scanning services and frontend display components

### Performance
- Initial project scanning must complete within 3 seconds for up to 50 projects
- UI navigation must respond within 500ms for all user interactions
- Memory usage should remain under 100MB for typical project collections (up to 1000 sessions)
- File system scanning should be efficient and avoid unnecessary directory traversals

### Security
- All file system access must be limited to the `~/.claude/projects/` directory and subdirectories
- No execution of arbitrary code or shell commands based on project content
- Input validation for all file paths to prevent directory traversal attacks
- Read-only access to all project files - no write operations permitted

### Reliability
- Graceful handling of corrupted or missing meta.json files
- Resilient operation when individual project directories are inaccessible
- Clear error reporting for file system permission issues
- Fallback display modes when project metadata is incomplete

### Usability
- Clean, minimalist interface focused on navigation and information display
- Consistent visual hierarchy with clear primary and secondary information
- Responsive design that works across desktop screen sizes
- Intuitive navigation patterns with clear back/forward affordances
- Loading states and progress indicators for longer operations
