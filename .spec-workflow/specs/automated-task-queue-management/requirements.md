# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Automated Task Queue Management provides the core orchestration capability for CC-Tasks, enabling users to create, prioritize, and automatically execute development tasks through Claude Code sessions. This feature transforms the current monitoring and viewing capabilities into a comprehensive task management system that can queue work, launch sessions automatically, and track completion progress toward defined goals.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature delivers the primary value proposition outlined in product.md: "Task Queue Management: Create, prioritize, and track development tasks with clear completion conditions." It directly addresses the core user pain point of "No centralized queue for organizing development work" and enables the key business objective of "Improve Development Velocity" by automating AI-assisted development workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Task Creation and Definition

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want to create development tasks with clear prompts and completion conditions, so that I can queue systematic AI-assisted work without manual session management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a new task THEN the system SHALL accept a detailed prompt describing the development work to be done
2. WHEN I define a task THEN the system SHALL require a specific completion condition that can be programmatically verified
3. WHEN I save a task THEN the system SHALL assign it a unique identifier and queue it for execution
4. IF multiple tasks are created THEN the system SHALL maintain them in a prioritized queue with clear ordering

### Requirement 2: Automated Session Launching

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically launch Claude Code sessions for queued tasks, so that work proceeds without manual intervention and I can focus on higher-level planning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task is ready for execution THEN the system SHALL automatically launch a new Claude Code session with the task prompt
2. WHEN a session is launched THEN the system SHALL provide the session with project context and completion conditions
3. WHEN multiple tasks are queued THEN the system SHALL respect task priorities and resource constraints
4. IF a session launch fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and log failure details

### Requirement 3: Completion Condition Monitoring

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want automatic detection when tasks reach their completion conditions, so that I can track progress and allocate resources efficiently without manual verification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task session is active THEN the system SHALL continuously monitor progress against the defined completion condition
2. WHEN a completion condition is met THEN the system SHALL automatically mark the task as completed and stop the session
3. WHEN a task stalls or encounters repeated failures THEN the system SHALL flag it for manual review
4. IF completion conditions are ambiguous THEN the system SHALL request clarification before proceeding

### Requirement 4: Task Priority and Dependency Management

**User Story:** As a technical lead, I want to prioritize tasks and define dependencies between them, so that critical work is completed first and dependent tasks wait for prerequisites.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a task THEN the system SHALL allow me to set priority levels (high, medium, low)
2. WHEN I define task dependencies THEN the system SHALL prevent dependent tasks from starting until prerequisites are completed
3. WHEN multiple high-priority tasks are queued THEN the system SHALL execute them based on creation time or explicit ordering
4. IF dependency chains become circular THEN the system SHALL detect and alert about the conflict

### Requirement 5: Resource Management and Concurrency Control

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to control how many Claude Code sessions run concurrently, so that system resources are managed efficiently and performance remains stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL respect configured limits on concurrent Claude Code sessions
2. WHEN resource limits are reached THEN new tasks SHALL queue until resources become available
3. WHEN sessions complete or fail THEN the system SHALL immediately start queued tasks if resources permit
4. IF system resource usage exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL temporarily pause new task launches

### Requirement 6: Task Progress Tracking and Reporting

**User Story:** As a development team member, I want to see detailed progress on all queued and active tasks, so that I can understand workload status and estimated completion times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tasks are in the queue THEN the system SHALL display their status, position, and estimated start time
2. WHEN tasks are executing THEN the system SHALL show real-time progress including token usage and current activity
3. WHEN tasks complete THEN the system SHALL provide summary reports with execution time, token usage, and outcomes
4. IF tasks fail THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error information and failure analysis

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each queue management component should handle one specific aspect (creation, execution, monitoring, completion)
- **Modular Design**: Task definition, session launching, and completion detection should be separate services
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize coupling between queue management and existing monitoring/viewing features
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between task management, session control, and monitoring systems

### Performance
- Task queue operations must complete within 500ms for responsive user experience
- System must support up to 50 concurrent tasks in queue without performance degradation
- Session launching must complete within 10 seconds or provide clear feedback on delays
- Completion condition checking must not impact Claude Code session performance

### Security
- Task creation must validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Session launching must use secure process isolation and prevent unauthorized access
- Task prompts must not expose sensitive information or credentials in logs
- Resource limits must prevent denial-of-service through excessive task creation

### Reliability
- Task queue must persist across system restarts and recover incomplete tasks
- Session failures must not corrupt the task queue or prevent other tasks from executing
- Completion condition monitoring must continue functioning during temporary system outages
- Task dependency resolution must handle complex scenarios without deadlocks

### Usability
- Task creation interface must guide users to write effective prompts and completion conditions
- Queue status must be immediately visible with clear visual indicators for different states
- Error messages must provide actionable guidance for resolving common task configuration issues
- Task management interface must support bulk operations for efficiency with large numbers of tasks
