# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Claude Code Session Content Viewer extends the existing Claude Code Project Browser by enabling users to view the actual conversation content within their JSONL session files. This feature transforms the project browser from a file system navigator into a fully functional conversation history viewer, allowing users to read, review, and understand their past Claude Code interactions. The viewer provides a clean, readable interface for conversation entries while maintaining the security and performance characteristics of the existing system.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature builds directly on the foundation established by the Claude Code Project Browser, completing the basic user journey from project discovery to conversation consumption. It enables users to fully leverage their stored conversation history for learning, reference, and decision-making about future interactions. The session content viewer establishes the infrastructure for advanced features like conversation search, analysis, and export capabilities while maintaining the minimal, focused approach of the existing system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Claude Code user, I want to click on a session from the project detail view and see the full conversation content, so that I can review my interaction history and understand the context of past sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking on a session card in the project detail view THEN the system SHALL navigate to a session content view showing the full conversation
2. WHEN the session content loads THEN the system SHALL parse the JSONL file and display all conversation entries in chronological order
3. IF the JSONL file is corrupted or unreadable THEN the system SHALL display an error message with guidance for the user
4. WHEN displaying conversation entries THEN the system SHALL show timestamps, entry types, and content in a readable format
5. WHEN the session has many entries THEN the system SHALL load and display content efficiently without blocking the interface

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Claude Code user, I want different types of conversation entries (user messages, assistant responses, tool use, tool results) to be visually distinguished, so that I can quickly understand the flow and structure of the conversation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying user messages THEN the system SHALL use distinct styling (color, alignment, or icons) to identify them clearly
2. WHEN displaying assistant responses THEN the system SHALL use different styling from user messages to show the distinction
3. WHEN displaying tool use entries THEN the system SHALL show the tool name, parameters, and distinguish them from regular messages
4. WHEN displaying tool results THEN the system SHALL show the output and clearly associate it with the corresponding tool use
5. WHEN entries have metadata (timestamps, IDs) THEN the system SHALL display this information in a non-intrusive way

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Claude Code user, I want to navigate through long conversations easily, so that I can find specific parts of the interaction without losing my place or becoming overwhelmed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conversation has more than 50 entries THEN the system SHALL provide smooth scrolling navigation
2. WHEN viewing a long conversation THEN the system SHALL maintain scroll position when returning from other views
3. WHEN conversation content extends beyond the viewport THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual indicators of additional content
4. WHEN navigating within a session THEN the system SHALL provide a way to jump to the beginning or end of the conversation
5. WHEN loading large conversations THEN the system SHALL show loading progress and not freeze the interface

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Claude Code user, I want clear navigation between the session list and session content views, so that I can easily move between browsing sessions and reading specific conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing session content THEN the system SHALL provide a clear "back to sessions" navigation option
2. WHEN navigating back to sessions THEN the system SHALL preserve the project context and return to the correct project detail view
3. WHEN in session content view THEN the system SHALL show breadcrumb navigation indicating current project and session
4. WHEN the session file path is invalid THEN the system SHALL redirect to the project detail view with an appropriate error message
5. WHEN switching between sessions in the same project THEN the system SHALL enable efficient navigation without losing context

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Claude Code user, I want the session content to be displayed in a clean, readable format that respects the original formatting while being easy to scan and understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying conversation content THEN the system SHALL preserve code blocks, formatting, and line breaks from the original content
2. WHEN showing long responses THEN the system SHALL provide readable typography with appropriate line spacing and font sizing
3. WHEN content contains special characters or formatting THEN the system SHALL handle it safely without breaking the layout
4. WHEN displaying timestamps THEN the system SHALL format them in a human-readable way relative to the conversation context
5. WHEN conversation entries are very long THEN the system SHALL maintain readability without horizontal scrolling requirements

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Separate JSONL parsing, conversation display, and navigation into distinct components
- **Modular Design**: Create reusable components for different entry types, conversation layout, and navigation
- **Dependency Management**: Build on existing project browser infrastructure without creating tight coupling
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between JSONL parsing service and display components

### Performance
- JSONL parsing must handle files up to 50MB without blocking the UI thread
- Conversation display must render smoothly for conversations with up to 1000 entries
- Initial content load must complete within 5 seconds for typical session files (1-10MB)
- Memory usage should remain efficient during long conversation viewing sessions
- Navigation between sessions should respond within 1 second

### Security
- All JSONL parsing must be safe against malformed or malicious content
- File system access must remain limited to Claude projects directory structure
- Content rendering must prevent XSS attacks from conversation content
- No execution of code or commands found in conversation content
- Input validation for all file paths and session identifiers

### Reliability
- Graceful handling of corrupted JSONL files with partial content recovery when possible
- Robust error handling for missing sessions, permission issues, and file system problems
- Consistent behavior when session files are modified during viewing
- Automatic error recovery and clear user guidance for common failure scenarios
- Maintain system stability when encountering unexpected JSONL format variations

### Usability
- Clean, scannable conversation layout that distinguishes entry types clearly
- Responsive design that works across different screen sizes and orientations
- Keyboard navigation support for accessibility compliance
- Loading states and progress indicators for longer operations
- Intuitive navigation patterns consistent with existing project browser interface
- Clear error messages that guide users toward resolution when problems occur
